{"question": "Katy makes coffee using teaspoons of sugar and cups of water in the ratio of 7:13. If she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water, calculate the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used.", "chain_of_thought": "1. Start by understanding the problem. The problem gives you a ratio of sugar to water that Katy uses to make her coffee. It also tells you the total amount of sugar and water she used. \n\n2. Identify the given ratio, which is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water.\n\n3. Understand that the problem asks for the amount of sugar she used. \n\n4. Note that the total amount of sugar and water used is 120. This is the sum of the parts of the ratio. \n\n5. To determine the amount of sugar she used, you need to find the value of each part of the ratio. To do this, divide the total amount (120) by the sum of the numbers in the ratio (7+13).\n\n6. After finding the value of each part, multiply this by the number representing sugar in the ratio (7) to find the amount of sugar used."}
