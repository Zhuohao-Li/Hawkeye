{"question": "Adrien's total salary was 30 percent higher than Lylah's. Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. If Adrien's and Lylah's salary increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary the two were receiving four years later?", "chain_of_thought": "1. Start by determining how much more Adrien was earning than Lylah four years ago. Since Adrien was earning 30% more than Lylah, you can find Lylah's salary by subtracting 30% of Adrien's salary from Adrien's salary. This gives Lylah's salary as $40,000 - ($40,000 * 0.30) = $28,000.\n\n2. Calculate Adrien's salary four years later. Since he was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago, multiply his old salary by 1.40. This gives Adrien's new salary as $40,000 * 1.40 = $56,000.\n\n3. Calculate Lylah's salary four years later. Since Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, multiply her old salary by 1.40. This gives Lylah's new salary as $28,000 * 1.40 = $39,200.\n\n4. Add up Lylah's and Adrien's new salaries to determine the total salary they were receiving four years later. Total salary = $56,000 + $39,200 = $95,200.\n\n5. Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is $95,200."}
