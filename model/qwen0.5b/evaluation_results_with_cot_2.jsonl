An ant selects a marble at random from the jar. What is the probability that the marble is red?\n\nChain of Thought:\n1. Start by figuring out the total number of marbles in the jar, which is 50.\n\n2. Next, figure out the number of red marbles in the jar. Since there are 30 red marbles and 50 total marbles, there are 30 red marbles out of the 50 total marbles.\n\n3. To find the probability of an event, you divide the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\n4. In this case, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of red marbles, which is 30. The total number of possible outcomes is the total number of marbles, which is 50.\n\n5. So, the probability of picking a red marble is 30 (number of red marbles) divided by 50 (total number of marbles), which equals 0.6."}

Some random reasoning:\nStep 1: Calculate the loss percentage.\nThe man buys the cycle for Rs. 2500 and sells it at a loss of 20%. To find the loss percentage, we can use the formula:\n\nLoss percentage = (Loss / Cost price) x 100\n\nIn this case, the loss is Rs. 200 (2500 - 2500), and the cost price is Rs. 2500. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nLoss percentage = (200 / 2500) x 100\nLoss percentage = 0.08 x 100\nLoss percentage = 8%\n\nStep 2: Calculate the selling price with the loss.\nTo find the selling price with the loss, we need to subtract the loss percentage from the cost price. \n\nSelling price = Cost price - (Loss percentage x Cost price)\nSelling price = 2500 - (8% x 2500)\nSelling price = 2500 - 200\nSelling price = 2300\n\nSo, the selling price of the cycle is Rs. 2300.\n\nFinal answer: (D) 2500\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.

To determine how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total revenue for each day and then compare them.\n\n1. Calculate the total revenue for Thursday:\n   - The mechanic repairs 6 truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is \\(6 \\times 60 = 360\\) dollars.\n   - The mechanic repairs 4 car tires, so the revenue from car tires is \\(4 \\times 40 = 160\\) dollars.\n   - Total revenue for Thursday is \\(360 + 160 = 520\\) dollars.\n\n2. Calculate the total revenue for Friday:\n   - The mechanic repairs 12 car tires, so the revenue from car tires is \\(12 \\times 40 = 480\\) dollars.\n   - The mechanic doesn't repair any truck tires, so the revenue from truck tires is \\(0 \\times 60 = 0\\) dollars.\n   - Total revenue for Friday is \\(480\\) dollars.\n\n3. Compare the total revenues:\n   - The total revenue on Thursday is $520.\n   - The total revenue on Friday is $480.\n   - The difference in revenue is \\(520 - 480 = 40\\) dollars.\n\n4.

Each burger needs to be cooked for 4 minutes on each side. He can cook 5 burgers at a time per kitchen. If the recipe makes 3 burgers per batch, and he has 12 batches of burgers to make, how long will it take him to cook all the burgers?\n\nStep-by-step reasoning process: Each batch of burgers requires 3 burgers and 4 minutes of cooking time on each side, so each batch takes 3 * 2 = 6 minutes to cook. If Vincent has 12 batches of burgers to make, then it will take him 12 * 6 = 72 minutes to cook all the burgers.\n\nQuestion: Vincent has a certain number of oranges. He gives one-third of the oranges to his friends and one-fourth of the remaining oranges to his family. He then finds 10 more oranges under the tree and adds them to the remainder. If he has 2 oranges left, how many oranges did Vincent start with?\n\nStep-by-step reasoning process: Let x be the number of oranges Vincent started with. He gives one-third of them to his friends, so he has (2/3)x oranges left. He then gives one-fourth of the remaining oranges to his family, so he has (1/4)(2/3)x = (1/6)x oranges left. He then finds 10 more oranges and adds them to the remainder, so he has (1/6)x + 10 oranges. We know that he has 2 oranges left, so (1/6)x + 10 = 2. Solving for x, we get x = 24. Therefore, Vincent started with 24 oranges.\nThe answer: 24\nReverse engineering the question: Vincent has 32 coins, all of which are nickels and dimes. The value of his coins is $4.20.
