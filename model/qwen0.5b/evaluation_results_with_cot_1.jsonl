{"index": 138, "model_output": "The answer is the subtotal before the delivery fee and tip, which is calculated as follows: \n\nSubtotal = (Cost of subs) + (Cost of bags of chips) + (Cost of cookies) \nSubtotal = ($7.50 x 2) + ($1.50 x 2) + ($1.00 x 2) \nSubtotal = $15.00 + $3.00 + $2.00 \nSubtotal = $18.00 \n\nDelivery fee = 20% of subtotal \nDelivery fee = 0.20 x $18.00 \nDelivery fee = $3.60 \n\nFinal cost = subtotal + delivery fee + tip \nFinal cost = $18.00 + $3.60 + $5.00 \nFinal cost = $26.60 \n\nSo, Rory's delivery order will cost $26.60."}
