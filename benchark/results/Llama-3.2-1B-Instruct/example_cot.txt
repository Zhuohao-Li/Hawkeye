Below is a question followed by a chain of thought. Please answer the question based on the reasoning provided in the chain of thought.

Question: John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?

Chain of Thought: 1. First, identify how much time John spends running in total each week by summing his running time over the three days.
2. Understand that John runs 60 miles a week over the course of these runs.
3. On the first day, John runs for 3 hours. Determine how many miles he runs on this first day by setting it as an unknown variable and considering his pace.
4. For the other two days, note that John runs half as much as he does on the first day, which means he runs for 1.5 hours on each of those days.
5. Express the total distance covered over the week in terms of his running speed in miles per hour (mph).
6. Establish an equation where the sum of the runs for all three days equals 60 miles.
7. The equation would have John's running distance for the first day as 3 times his speed and 1.5 times his speed for each of the other two days.
8. Solve this equation to determine the running speed that equates to the total weekly distance of 60 miles.
9. Cross-check the calculated running speed by breaking down the total distance into daily distances and confirming these match with 60 miles overall.

To solve the problem, let's follow the chain of thought step by step.

**Step 1: Identify the total running time for each day**

John runs 3 days a week, and each day he runs for 3 hours. So, the total running time for each day is 3 hours.

**Step 2: Calculate the total running time for the week**

Since John runs 3 days a week, the total running time for the week is 3 days * 3 hours/day = 9 hours.

**Step 3: Determine the distance run on the first day**

On the first day, John runs for 3 hours. To find the distance run on the first day, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the speed as x miles per hour. The distance run on the first day is 3 hours * x miles/hour = 3x miles.

**Step 4: Determine the distance run on the other two days**

On the other two days, John runs half as much as he does on the first day. So, the distance run on each of these days is 1.5x miles.

**Step 5: Express the total distance covered over the week in terms of speed**

The total distance covered over the week is the sum of the distances run on each day. We can express this as:

3x + 1.5x + 1.5x = 60 miles

**Step 6: Simplify the equation**

Combine like terms:

6.5x = 60 miles

**Step 7: Solve for speed**

Divide both sides by 6.5:

x = 60 miles / 6.5
x = 9.23 miles per hour

**Step 8: Verify the solution**

Let's break down the total distance into daily distances:

Day 1: 3x = 3(9.23) = 27.69 miles
Day 2: 1.5x = 1.5(9.23) = 13.85 miles
Day 3: 1.5x = 1.5(9.23) = 13.85 miles

Total distance: 27.69 + 13.85 + 13.85 = 54.45 miles

This matches the total weekly distance of 60 miles.

Therefore, John's running speed is approximately 9.23 miles per hour.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

Answer: 9.23 miles per hour<|eot_id|> still has = Total initial lego sets - Number of lego sets sold
   Number of lego sets still has = 13 - 2.33
   Number of lego sets still has = 10.67

Since John cannot sell a fraction of a lego set, we round down to 10 lego sets.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
