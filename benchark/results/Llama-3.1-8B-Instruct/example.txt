To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to first calculate how many calories you have left to consume. 

You have already consumed 1800 calories, and your daily target is 2000 calories. So, you have 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left.

Since each serving of chips has 250 calories, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, you can eat 0.8 * 5 = 4 servings.

Since each serving is 250 calories, and you have 200 calories left, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, you can eat 0.8 * 5 = 4 servings.

Since each serving is 250 calories, and you have 200 calories left, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, you can eat 0.8 * 5 = 4 servings.

Since each serving is 250 calories, and you have 200 calories left, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, you can eat 0.8 * 5 = 4 servings.

Since each serving is 250 calories, and you have 200 calories left, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, you can eat 0.8 * 5 = 4 servings.

Since each serving is 250 calories, and you have 200 calories left, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, you can eat 0.8 * 5 = 4 servings.

Since each serving is 250 calories, and you have 200 calories left, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.

Since there are 5 servings in the 300g bag, you can eat 0.8 * 5 = 4 servings.

Since each serving is 250 calories, and you have 200 calories left, you can eat 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.
