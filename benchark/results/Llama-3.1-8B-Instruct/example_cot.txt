Below is a question followed by a chain of thought. Please answer the question based on the reasoning provided in the chain of thought.

Question: Candice put 80 post-it notes in her purse before she headed out to her job at the coffee shop.  On her way, she stopped off at the store and purchased a package of Post-it notes;  At work, she placed a single Post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.  If she had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, how many Post-it notes were in the package that she purchased?

Chain of Thought: 1. Start by identifying the number of Post-it notes Candice initially had before purchasing any more. According to the problem, she had 80 Post-it notes.
2. Acknowledge that Candice bought an additional package of Post-it notes, but we do not know how many were in this package. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought as 'x'.
3. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the additional package. This is the sum of the initial notes and the notes in the package, which can be represented as '80 + x'.
4. Understand that at her job, Candice used 1 Post-it note for each of the 220 cups of coffee. This means she used a total of 220 Post-it notes at work.
5. With the information that Candice had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using them at work, setup an equation to represent the situation before considering her remaining notes. The equation represents post-use as follows: '(80 + x) - 220 = 23'.
6. Simplify the equation by combining like terms and solving for 'x'. Clarify what each term in the equation represents: '80 + x' is the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after the purchase, and '220' is the number of notes used, setting up the equation: '80 + x - 220 = 23'.
7. Rearrange and simplify the equation: '80 + x = 220 + 23'.
8. Simplifying further: '80 + x = 243'.
9. Solve for 'x' by subtracting 80 from both sides of the equation to isolate 'x': 'x = 243 - 80'.
10. Perform the subtraction to find the value of 'x', which represents the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased. This will yield the solution indicating the number of notes in the purchased package.

Let's follow the chain of thought to solve for 'x'.

1. Start by identifying the number of Post-it notes Candice initially had before purchasing any more. According to the problem, she had 80 Post-it notes.
2. Acknowledge that Candice bought an additional package of Post-it notes, but we do not know how many were in this package. Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package she bought as 'x'.
3. Determine the total number of Post-it notes Candice had after purchasing the additional package. This is the sum of the initial notes and the notes in the package, which can be represented as '80 + x'.
4. Understand that at her job, Candice used 1 Post-it note for each of the 220 cups of coffee. This means she used a total of 220 Post-it notes at work.
5. With the information that Candice had 23 Post-it notes remaining after using them at work, setup an equation to represent the situation before considering her remaining notes. The equation represents post-use as follows: '(80 + x) - 220 = 23'.

8. Simplifying further: '80 + x = 243'.
9. Solve for 'x' by subtracting 80 from both sides of the equation to isolate 'x': 'x = 243 - 80'.
10. Perform the subtraction to find the value of 'x', which represents the number of Post-it notes in the package Candice purchased. This will yield the solution indicating the number of notes in the purchased package.

x = 243 - 80
x = 163

Therefore, Candice purchased a package of 163 Post-it notes.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
