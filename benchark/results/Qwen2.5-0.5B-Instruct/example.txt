Question: Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \( x \).

1. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. So, she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners at the green house.
2. She sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \) vacuum cleaners at the red house.
3. She sold half of what was left at the orange house. So, she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

After selling these, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, the total number of vacuum cleaners she started with is the sum of the vacuum cleaners she sold and the vacuum cleaners she has left:

\[ x = \frac{x}{3} + 2 + \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{x}{3} + 2 \right) + 5 \]

Let's simplify this equation step by step:

First, distribute the 2 in the second term:

\[ x = \frac{x}{3} + 2 + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{x}{3} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2 + 5 \]

\[ x = \frac{x}{3} + 2 + \frac{x}{6} + 1 + 5 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ x = \frac{x}{3} + \frac{x}{6} + 2 + 1 + 5 \]

\[ x = \frac{2x}{6} + \frac{x}{6} + 8 \]

\[ x = \frac{3x}{6} + \frac{8}{6} \]

\[ x = \frac{3x + 8}{6} \]

Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:

\[ 6x = 3x + 8 \]

Subtract \( 3x \) from both sides:

\[ 3x = 8 \]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[ x = \frac{8}{3} \]

So, Melanie started with \( \frac{8}{3} \) vacuum cleaners, which is approximately 2.67. However, since the number of vacuum cleaners must be a whole number, we can conclude that Melanie<|im_end|>
