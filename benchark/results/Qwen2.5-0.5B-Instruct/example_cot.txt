Below is a question followed by a chain of thought. Please answer the question based on the reasoning provided in the chain of thought.

Question: Melanie is a door-to-door saleswoman. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Chain of Thought: 1. Let's define the total number of vacuum cleaners that Melanie started with as X. 
2. Initially, Melanie sold one-third of X vacuum cleaners at the green house. Therefore, she sold (1/3)X vacuum cleaners at the green house.
3. After selling at the green house, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is X - (1/3)X = (2/3)X.
4. Melanie then sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.
5. After selling at the red house, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is (2/3)X - 2.
6. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. Hence, she sold (1/2)((2/3)X - 2) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
7. After selling at the orange house, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is ((2/3)X - 2) - [(1/2)((2/3)X - 2)].
8. We know from the problem statement that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.
9. Therefore, we set up the equation: ((2/3)X - 2) - [(1/2)((2/3)X - 2)] = 5.
10. Solve this equation to find the value of X, which represents the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as X.

2. Initially, Melanie sold one-third of X vacuum cleaners at the green house. Therefore, she sold (1/3)X vacuum cleaners at the green house.

3. After selling at the green house, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is X - (1/3)X = (2/3)X.

4. Melanie then sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.

5. After selling at the red house, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is (2/3)X - 2.

6. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house. Therefore, she sold (1/2)((2/3)X - 2) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.

7. After selling at the orange house, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is ((2/3)X - 2) - [(1/2)((2/3)X - 2)].

8. We know from the problem statement that after all these sales, Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

9. Therefore, we set up the equation: ((2/3)X - 2) - [(1/2)((2/3)X - 2)] = 5.

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. First, simplify the equation:
   ((2/3)X - 2) - [(1/2)((2/3)X - 2)] = 5
   ((2/3)X - 2) - (1/2)((2/3)X - 2) = 5

2. Distribute the -1/2:
   ((2/3)X - 2) - (1/2)(2/3)X + 1 = 5

3. Simplify the equation:
   ((2/3)X - 2) - (1/3)X + 1 = 5

4. Combine like terms:
   ((2/3)X - (1/3)X) - 2 + 1 = 5
   (1/3)X - 1 = 5

5. Add 1 to both sides of the equation:
   (1/3)X = 6

6. Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for X:

 of the initial notes and the notes used at work, which is 80 + x + 220.
6. **Setting Up the Equation**: The equation representing the situation before considering the remaining notes is: 
   \[
   (80 + x) - 220 = 23
   \]
7. **Simplifying the Equation**: 
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23
   \]
