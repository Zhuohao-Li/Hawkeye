Question: I have 10 liters of orange drink that are two-thirds water and I wish to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But as I pour it, I spill one liter of the orange drink. How much water is in the remaining 24 liters?

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink after accounting for the spill.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of water in the original orange drink.
The original orange drink is 10 liters and two-thirds of it is water.
\[
\text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of water in the original pineapple drink.
The original pineapple drink is 15 liters and three-fifths of it is water.
\[
\text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = \frac{45}{5} = 9 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of water before the spill.
\[
\text{Total water} = \text{Water in orange drink} + \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{20}{3} + 9 = \frac{20}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{47}{3} \approx 15.67 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 4: Account for the spill.
One liter of the orange drink is spilled, so the amount of water in the remaining orange drink is:
\[
\text{Remaining water in orange drink} = \frac{20}{3} - 1 = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \approx 5.67 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount of water after the spill.
\[
\text{Total water after spill} = \text{Remaining water in orange drink} + \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{17}{3} + 9 = \frac{17}{3} + \frac{27}{3} = \frac{44}{3} \approx 14.67 \text{ liters}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total volume of the remaining mixture.
The total volume of the remaining mixture is:
\[
\text{Total volume} = 10 - 1 +<|im_end|>
