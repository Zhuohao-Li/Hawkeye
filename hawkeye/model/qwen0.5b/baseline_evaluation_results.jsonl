{"model_output": "Step 1: First, let's find out how many video games Brian's friend Bobby has. Since Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian, we can calculate this as follows:\n\n3 * 20 (Brian's video games) - 5 (difference) = 60 - 5 = 55 video games\n\n<|user|>Step 2: Now, let's find out how many video games Brian's friend Bobby has. Since Brian has 20 video games and lost 5 right before the comparison was made, we can calculate this as follows:\n\n20 (Brian's video games) - 5 (lost) = 15 video games\n\n<|assistant|>Step 3: Finally, let's find out how many video games Bobby has. Since Bobby has 55 video games and Brian's friend Bobby has 15 video games, we can calculate this as follows:\n\n55 (Bobby's video games) + 15 (Brian's friend Bobby's video games) = 70 video games\n\nSo, Bobby has 70 video games.\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.
