Below is a question followed by a chain of thought. Please answer the question based on the reasoning provided in the chain of thought.

Question: Sasha notices that prices for lumber have gone up 50% in the last few months after she bought some lumber. Since she has leftovers, she decides to sell them. She has leftover ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards she bought for $16 each. If she sells them all, how much profit does she make?

Chain of Thought: 1. First, determine the amount Sasha paid for all the lumber she originally bought. Calculate the total cost for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards and the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards. \n2. To find the cost for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards: Multiply the cost of one board, which is $10, by the number of boards, which is 10. \n3. To find the cost for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards: Multiply the cost of one board, which is $16, by the number of boards, which is 5. \n4. Add the total costs from step 2 and step 3 to find the total initial investment cost of all lumber boards. \n5. Next, calculate the selling price for each type of board by accounting for the 50% increase in lumber prices. \n6. To find the new selling price for each 2 x 4 x 10 board: Multiply the original price of one board ($10) by 1.5 to account for the 50% increase. \n7. To find the new selling price for each 4 x 4 x 10 board: Multiply the original price of one board ($16) by 1.5. \n8. Calculate the total revenue by summing up the products of the calculated selling prices and their respective quantities: Multiply the new price of a 2 x 4 x 10 board by 10 and the new price of a 4 x 4 x 10 board by 5. \n9. Determine the profit by subtracting the original total cost (calculated in step 4) from the total revenue calculated in step 8. \n10. The result from step 9 will give the total profit Sasha makes by selling all her leftover boards.

Let's go through the calculations step by step based on the chain of thought provided:

1. **Calculate the total cost for the ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for 10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times \$10 \text{ per board} = \$100
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for the five 4 x 4 x 10 boards:**
   \[
   \text{Cost for 5 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times \$16 \text{ per board} = \$80
   \]

3. **Calculate the total initial investment cost of all lumber boards:**
   \[
   \text{Total initial cost} = \$100 + \$80 = \$180
   \]

4. **Calculate the new selling price for each type of board:**
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{New selling price} = \$10 \times 1.5 = \$15
     \]
   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{New selling price} = \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24
     \]

5. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the boards:**
   - Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from 2 x 4 x 10 boards} = 10 \text{ boards} \times \$15 \text{ per board} = \$150
     \]
   - Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from 4 x 4 x 10 boards} = 5 \text{ boards} \times \$24 \text{ per board} = \$120
     \]
   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \$150 + \$120 = \$270
     \]

6. **Calculate the profit:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total initial cost} = \$270 - \$180 = \$90<|im_end|>
