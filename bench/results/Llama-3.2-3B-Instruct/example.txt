Question: If Marcy works for the same company for 40 years, she gets an annual pension of $50,000/year. Starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total value of the pension and then determine the annual pension amount after 30 years.

Initially, Marcy receives an annual pension of $50,000 for 20 years. The total value of this pension is:

$50,000/year x 20 years = $1,000,000

After 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. This means that the annual pension amount will increase by 5% of the initial pension amount each year.

Let's calculate the annual pension amount after 20 years:

Year 21: $50,000 + (5% of $50,000) = $50,000 + $2,500 = $52,500
Year 22: $52,500 + (5% of $52,500) = $52,500 + $2,625 = $55,125
Year 23: $55,125 + (5% of $55,125) = $55,125 + $2,756.25 = $57,881.25
Year 24: $57,881.25 + (5% of $57,881.25) = $57,881.25 + $2,939.06 = $60,820.31
Year 25: $60,820.31 + (5% of $60,820.31) = $60,820.31 + $3,041.01 = $63,861.32
Year 26: $63,861.32 + (5% of $63,861.32) = $63,861.32 + $3,192.56 = $67,053.88
Year 27: $67,053.88 + (5% of $67,053.88) = $67,053.88 + $3,350.79 = $70,404.67
Year 28: $70,404.67 + (5% of $70,404.67) = $70,404.67 + $3,520.23 = $73,924.90
Year 29: $73,924.90 + (5% of $73,924.90) = $73,924.90 + $3,697.24 = $77,622.14
Year 30: $77,622.14 + (5% of $77,<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
