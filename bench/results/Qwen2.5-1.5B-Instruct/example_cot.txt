Below is a question followed by a chain of thought. Please answer the question based on the reasoning provided in the chain of thought.

Question: According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories?

Chain of Thought: 1. Begin by identifying the number of remaining calories available within the daily target after accounting for already consumed calories. This involves subtracting the calories already consumed (1800) from the daily calorie target (2000). 
2. Calculate the caloric intake available for the chips: subtract 1800 from 2000, which leaves 200 calories to still consume within the daily limit. 
3. Determine the calories per serving provided by the bag of chips, which is 250 calories per serving. 
4. Recognize that each serving from the 300g bag of chips corresponds to 250 calories and that there are 5 servings in the entire bag.
5. Calculate the weight of one serving of chips by dividing the total weight of the bag (300g) by the number of servings (5), resulting in 60 grams per serving. 
6. Establish the proportionate amount of chips that can be consumed according to the remaining calorie budget (200 calories). 
7. Since one serving (60g) corresponds to 250 calories, establish a ratio to determine how many grams correspond to 200 calories. 
8. Set up a proportion where X grams represent the 200 remaining allowable calories based on the established one serving of 60 grams corresponding to 250 calories.
9. Use the proportion: (60 grams / 250 calories) = (X grams / 200 calories). 
10. Perform a cross-multiplication to solve for X: 250X = 60 * 200. 
11. Simplify and solve the equation to find X, which represents the number of grams that can be consumed without exceeding the calorie limit.

To answer the question, we need to follow the chain of thought provided:

1. **Remaining Calories**: Subtract the calories already consumed from the daily calorie target.
   \[
   2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories remaining}
   \]

2. **Calories per Serving**: The bag of chips has 250 calories per serving.
   \[
   \text{Calories per serving} = 250 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Weight of One Serving**: Calculate the weight of one serving by dividing the total weight of the bag by the number of servings.
   \[
   \text{Weight of one serving} = \frac{300 \text{ grams}}{5 \text{ servings}} = 60 \text{ grams}
   \]

4. **Proportionate Amount**: Establish the proportionate amount of chips that can be consumed based on the remaining calorie budget.
   \[
   \text{Proportion} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = \frac{4}{5}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Number of Servings**: Use the proportion to determine how many servings correspond to the remaining 200 calories.
   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{200 \text{ calories}}{250 \text{ calories per serving}} = \frac{4}{5} \text{ servings}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Total Weight**: Multiply the number of servings by the weight of one serving to find the total weight of chips that can be consumed.
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \frac{4}{5} \text{ servings} \times 60 \text{ grams per serving} = 48 \text{ grams}
   \]

Therefore, you can eat 48 grams of chips without exceeding your daily calorie target.<|im_end|>
