To determine the total cost for Kylar to buy 16 glasses, we need to consider the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and each subsequent glass costs 60% of the price of the previous glass.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cost of the first glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5
   \]

2. **Cost of the second glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times \$5 = \$3
   \]

3. **Cost of the third glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the third glass} = 0.60 \times \$3 = \$1.80
   \]

4. **Cost of the fourth glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the fourth glass} = 0.60 \times \$1.80 = \$1.08
   \]

5. **Cost of the fifth glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the fifth glass} = 0.60 \times \$1.08 = \$0.648
   \]

6. **Cost of the sixth glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the sixth glass} = 0.60 \times \$0.648 = \$0.3888
   \]

7. **Cost of the seventh glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the seventh glass} = 0.60 \times \$0.3888 = \$0.23328
   \]

8. **Cost of the eighth glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the eighth glass} = 0.60 \times \$0.23328 = \$0.139968
   \]

9. **Cost of the ninth glass:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of the ninth glass} = 0.60 \times \$0.139968 = \$0.0839808
   \]

10. **Cost of the tenth glass:**
    \[
    \text{Cost of the tenth glass} = 0.60 \times \$0.083980<|im_end|>
