Below is a question followed by a chain of thought. Please answer the question based on the reasoning provided in the chain of thought.

Question: John runs 60 miles a week. He runs 3 days a week.  He runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days he runs.  How fast does he run?

Chain of Thought: 1. First, identify how much time John spends running in total each week by summing his running time over the three days.
2. Understand that John runs 60 miles a week over the course of these runs.
3. On the first day, John runs for 3 hours. Determine how many miles he runs on this first day by setting it as an unknown variable and considering his pace.
4. For the other two days, note that John runs half as much as he does on the first day, which means he runs for 1.5 hours on each of those days.
5. Express the total distance covered over the week in terms of his running speed in miles per hour (mph).
6. Establish an equation where the sum of the runs for all three days equals 60 miles.
7. The equation would have John's running distance for the first day as 3 times his speed and 1.5 times his speed for each of the other two days.
8. Solve this equation to determine the running speed that equates to the total weekly distance of 60 miles.
9. Cross-check the calculated running speed by breaking down the total distance into daily distances and confirming these match with 60 miles overall.

Let's break down the problem step by step using the chain of thought provided.

1. **Total Running Time Calculation:**
   - First day: 3 hours
   - Second day: 1.5 hours
   - Third day: 1.5 hours
   - Total running time per week: \(3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6\) hours

2. **Total Distance:**
   - John runs 60 miles a week.

3. **Distance on the First Day:**
   - Let \(v\) be John's running speed in miles per hour (mph).
   - Distance on the first day: \(3v\) miles.

4. **Distance on the Other Two Days:**
   - Distance on the second day: \(1.5v\) miles.
   - Distance on the third day: \(1.5v\) miles.
   - Total distance on the other two days: \(1.5v + 1.5v = 3v\) miles.

5. **Total Distance Equation:**
   - The sum of the distances over the three days equals the total weekly distance:
     \[
     3v + 3v = 60
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6v = 60
     \]

6. **Solve for \(v\):**
   - Divide both sides by 6:
     \[
     v = \frac{60}{6} = 10 \text{ mph}
     \]

7. **Verification:**
   - First day: \(3 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ mph} = 30 \text{ miles}\)
   - Second day: \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)
   - Third day: \(1.5 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}\)
   - Total distance: \(30 + 15 + 15 = 60 \text{ miles}\)

The calculations confirm that John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. Therefore, the answer is that John runs at a speed of 10 mph.<|im_end|>
